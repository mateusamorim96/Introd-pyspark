# About this website {.unnumbered}

Welcome! This is the initial page for the "Open Access" HTML version of the book "Introduction to `pyspark`", written by [Pedro Duarte Faria](https://pedro-faria.netlify.app/). This book provides an introduction to [`pyspark`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/), which is a python API to [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/).

This book is still under active construction. This means that not all chapters are ready yet, and some of the contents of the book might change in the close future.
