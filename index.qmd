# Welcome!

Hello! This is the initial page! This book provides an introduction to `pyspark`, but, because `pyspark` is a python API to Apache Spark, this book is about Apache Spark too.


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

if (Sys.info()["sysname"] == "Windows") {
  py_path <- "C:/Users/pedro/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python39/python.exe"
  reticulate::use_python(py_path)
}
```
