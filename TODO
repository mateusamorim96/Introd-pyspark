TODOS:
- Maybe the section for pulling data from sql databases whould be in another chapter;
- Add a chapter for date and datetime manipulation tools;
- Add a second chapter for transforming dataframes. This time, presenting different types of transformation (union, distinct, drop_duplicates, join, na functions);
- Add a section to describe the new `withColumns()` method: https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/pyspark.sql/api/pyspark.sql.DataFrame.withColumns.html
