TODOS:
- Maybe the section for pulling data from sql databases whould be in another chapter;
- Add sections describing how to use contains(), startswith() and endswith() methods to filter rows;
- Add a chapter for date and datetime manipulation tools;
- Add a second chapter for transforming dataframes. This time, presenting different types of transformation (union, distinct, drop_duplicates, join);
