TODOS:
- "Partitions" of a DataFrame is useful for explaining the difference between narrow and wide transformations (but, this difference does not need to be in the DataFrame chapter, maybe this is a more advanced topic);
- Maybe, the "Partitions of a Spark DataFrame" section, should be moved to a different chapter;
