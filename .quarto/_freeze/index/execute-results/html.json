This is the initial page for the \"Open Access\" HTML version of the book \"Introduction to `pyspark`\", written by [Pedro Duarte Faria](https://pedro-faria.netlify.app/). This book provides an introduction to [`pyspark`](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/), which is a python API to [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/).\n\nThis book is still under active construction. This means that not all chapters are ready yet, and some of the contents of the book might change in the close future.\n\n\n\n\n",
