title: "Transforming your Spark DataFrame"
---

## Introduction

Virtually every data analysis or data pipeline will include some ETL (*Extract, Transform, Load*) process, and the T is an essential part of it. Because, you almost never have an input data, or a initial DataFrame that perfectly fits your needs. 

That means, that you almost always have to transform the initial data that you have, to a specific format that you can use in your analysis. In this chapter, you will learn how to apply some of these basic transformations to your Spark DataFrame.

## Defining transformations

Spark DataFrames are immutable, meaning that, they cannot be directly changed. But you can use an existing DataFrame to create a new one, based on a set of transformations. In other words, you define a new DataFrame as a transformed version of an older DataFrame.

Basically every `pyspark` program that you write will have such transformations. Spark support many types of transformations, however, in this chapter, we will focus on four basic transformations that you can apply to a DataFrame:

- Filtering rows;
- Sorting rows;
- Adding or deleting columns;
- Calculate aggregates;

Therefore, when you apply one of the above transformations to an existing DataFrame, you will get a new DataFrame as a result. You usually combine multiple transformations together to get your desired result. As a first example, lets get back to the `df` DataFrame:

```{python}
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
spark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()
from datetime import date
from pyspark.sql import Row

data = [
  Row(id = 1, value = 28.3, date = date(2021,1,1)),
  Row(id = 2, value = 15.8, date = date(2021,1,1)),
  Row(id = 3, value = 20.1, date = date(2021,1,2)),
  Row(id = 4, value = 12.6, date = date(2021,1,3))
]

df = spark.createDataFrame(data)
```

In the example below, to create a new DataFrame called `big_values`, we begin with the `df` DataFrame, then, we filter its rows where `value` is greater than 15, then, we select `date` and `value` columns, then, we sort the rows based on the `value` column. So, this set of sequential transformations (filter it, then, select it, then, order it, ...) defines what this new `big_values` DataFrame is.

```{python}
from pyspark.sql.functions import col
# You define a chain of transformations to
# create a new DataFrame
big_values = df\
  .filter(col('value') > 15)\
  .select('date', 'value')\
  .orderBy('value')
```

Thus, to apply a transformation to an existing DataFrame, we use DataFrame methods such as `select()`, `filter()`, `withColumn()`, `orderBy()` and `agg()`. Remember, these are methods from the python class that defines Apache Spark DataFrame's (i.e. `pyspark.sql.dataframe.DataFrame`). This means that you can apply these transformations only to Spark DataFrames, and no other kind of python object. 

Each one of these methods create a *lazily evaluated transformation*. Once again, we see the **lazy** aspect of Spark doing its work here. All these transformation methods are lazily evaluated, meaning that, Spark will only check if they make sense with the initial DataFrame that you have. Spark will not actually perform these transformations on your initial DataFrame, not untill you trigger these transformations with an **action**.

## Triggering calculations with actions {#sec-dataframe-actions}

Therefore, Spark will avoid performing any heavy calculation until such calculation is really needed. But how or when Spark will face this decision? **When it encounters an action**. An action is the tool you have to trigger Spark to actually perform the transformations you have defined.

>> An action instructs Spark to compute the result from a series of transformations. [@chambers2018].

There are four kinds of actions in Spark:

- Showing an output in the console;
- Writing data to some file or data source;
- Collecting data from a Spark DataFrame to native objects in python (or Java, Scala, R, etc.);
- Counting the number of rows in a Spark DataFrame;

You already know the first type of action, because we used it before with the `show()` method. This `show()` method is an action by itself, because you are asking Spark to show some output to you. So we can make Spark to actually calculate the transformations that defines the `big_values` DataFrame, by asking Spark to show this DataFrame to us.

```{python}
big_values.show()
```

Another very useful action is the `count()` method, that gives you the number of rows in a DataFrame. To be able to count the number of rows in a DataFrame, Spark needs to access this DataFrame in the first place. That is why this `count()` method behaves as an action. Spark will perform the transformations that defines `big_values` to access the actual rows of this DataFrame and count them.

```{python}
big_values.count()
```

Furthermore, sometimes, you want to collect the data of a Spark DataFrame to use it inside python. In other words, sometimes you need to do some work that Spark cannot do by itself. To do so, you collect part of the data that is being generated by Spark, and store it inside a normal python object to use it in a standard python program. 

That is what the `collect()` method do. It transfers all the data of your Spark DataFrame into a standard python list that you can easily access with python. More specifically, you get a python list full of `Row()` values:

```{python}
data = big_values.collect()
print(data)
```

The `take()` method is very similar to `collect()`. But you usually apply `take()` when you need to collect just a small section of your DataFrame (and not the entire thing), like the first `n` rows.

```{python}
n = 1
first_row = big_values.take(n)
print(first_row)
```

The last action would be the `write()` method, but we will explain this method latter, in the @sec-import-export.

 
## Understanding narrow and wide transformations

There are two kinds of transformations in Spark: narrow and wide transformations. Remember, a Spark DataFrame is divided into many small parts (called partitions), and, these parts are spread across the cluster. The basic difference between narrow and wide transformations, is if the transformation forces Spark to read data from multiple partitions to generate a single part of the result of that transformation.

More technically, narrow transformations are simply transformations where 1 input data (or 1 partition of the input DataFrame) contributes to only 1 partition of the output. 

![Presenting narrow transformations](../Figures/narrow-transformations.png){#fig-narrow-transformations fig-align="center"}

In other words, each partition of your input DataFrame will be used (*separately*) to generate one individual part of the result of your transformation. As another perspective, you can understand narrow transformations as those where Spark does not need to read the entire input DataFrame to generate a single and small piece of your result.

A classic example of narrow transformation is a filter. For example, suppose you have three students (Anne, Carls and Mike), and that each one has a bag full of blue, orange and red balls mixed. Now, suppose you asked them to collect all the red balls of these bags, and combined them in a single bag. 

To do this task, Mike does not need to know what balls are inside of the bag of Carls or Anne. He just need to collect the red balls that are solely on his bag. At the end of the task, each student will have a part of the end result (that is, all the red balls that were in his own bag), and they just need to combine all these parts to get the total result. 

The same thing applies to filters in Spark DataFrames. When you filter all the rows where the column `state` is equal to `"Alaska"`, Spark will filter all the rows in each partition separately, and then, will combine all the outputs to get the final result.

In contrast, wide transformations are the opposite of that. In wide transformations, Spark needs to use more than 1 partition of the input DataFrame to generate a small piece of the result.


![Presenting wide transformations](../Figures/wide-transformations.png){#fig-wide-transformations fig-align="center"}

When this kind of transformation happens, each worker node of the cluster needs to share his partition with the others. In other words, what happens is a partition shuffle. Each worker node sends his partition to the others, so they can have access to it, while performing their assigned tasks.

Partition shuffles are a very popular topic in Apache Spark, because they can be a serious source of inefficiency in your Spark application. In more details, when these shuffles happens, Spark needs to write data back to the hard disk of the computer, and this is not a very fast operation. It does not mean that wide transformations are bad or slow, just that the shuffles they are producing can be a problem.

A classic example of wide operation is a grouped aggregation. For example, lets suppose we had a DataFrame with the daily sales of multiple stores spread across the country, and, we wanted to calculate the total sales per city/region. To calculate the total sales of a specific city, like SÃ£o Paulo, Spark would need to find all the rows that corresponds to this city, before adding the values, and these rows can be spread across multiple partitions of the cluster.
