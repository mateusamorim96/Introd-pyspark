# Introducing Apache Spark {#sec-introd-spark}

## Introduction

In essence, `pyspark` is an API to Apache Spark (or simply Spark). In other words, with `pyspark` we can build Spark applications using the python language. So, by learning a little more about Spark, you will understand a lot more about `pyspark`.

<!-- ## What is Big Data? -->

<!-- The classical question: "how much big is big?" Even today, there is no clear definition to what "big data" is. But, the most accepted one is this: "big data is any data that we can no longer store, process or manage using traditional computing methods". In other words, big data is data whose volume, complexity or diversity makes it really hard or impossible to deal with this data on a single machine, like a desktop or a laptop. -->

<!-- Realize that, the meaning of "big" can vary in this matter. It is not only the volume (how much GB, TB or PB) of the data that can build a barrier. For example, maybe the velocity is the key issue here. A lot of companies (such as Google or Facebook) need to process data in real time, as it is being generated, so they need to think in terms of continuous flows and process, rather than storing and processing this data latter [@mitsloan2013]. In contrast, maybe the problem is that we need to deal with many different kinds of data at the same time, like videos, images and tree formats (i.e. XML and JSON like structures). -->

## What is Spark?

Spark is a multi-language engine for large-scale data processing that supports both single-node machines and clusters of machines [@sparkdoc]. Nowadays, Spark became the de facto standard for structure and manage big data applications.

It has a number of features that its predecessors did not have, like the capacity for in-memory processing and stream processing [@karau2015]. But, the most important feature of all, is that Spark is an **unified platform** for big data processing [@chambers2018]. 

This means that Spark comes with multiple built-in libraries and tools that deals with different aspects of the work with big data. It has a built-in SQL engine[^03-spark-1] for performing large-scale data processing; a complete library for scalable machine learning (`MLib`[^03-spark-2]); a stream processing engine[^03-spark-3] for streaming analytics; and much more;

In general, big companies have many different data necessities, and as a result, the engineers and analysts may have to combine and integrate many tools and techniques together, so they can build many different data pipelines to fulfill these necessities. But this approach can create a very serious dependency problem, which imposes a great barrier to support this workflow. This is one of the big reasons why Spark got so successful. It eliminates big part of this problem, by already including almost everything that you might need to use.

> Spark is designed to cover a wide range of workloads that previously required separate distributed systems ... By supporting these workloads in the same engine, Spark makes it easy and inexpensive to combine different processing types, which is often necessary in production data analysis pipelines. In addition, it reduces the management burden of maintaining separate tools [@karau2015].

## Spark application

Your personal computer can do a lot of things, but, it cannot efficiently deal with huge amounts of data. For this situation, we need several machines working together, adding up their resources to deal with the volume or complexity of the data. Spark is the framework that coordinates the computations across this set of machines [@chambers2018]. Because of this, a relevant part of Spark's structure is deeply connected to distributed computing models.

You probably do not have a cluster of machines at home. So, while following the examples in this book, you will be running Spark on a single machine (i.e. single node mode). But lets just forget about this detail for a moment.

In every Spark application, you always have a single machine behaving as the driver node, and multiple machines behaving as the worker nodes. The driver node is responsible for managing the Spark application, i.e. asking for resources, distributing tasks to the workers, collecting and compiling the results, .... The worker nodes are responsible for executing the tasks that are assigned to them, and they need to send the results of these tasks back to the driver node.

Every Spark application is distributed into two different and independent processes: 1) a driver process; 2) and a set of executor processes [@chambers2018]. The driver process, or, the driver program, is where your application starts, and it is executed by the driver node. This driver program is responsible for: 1) maintaining information about your Spark Application; 2) responding to a user's program or input; 3) and analyzing, distributing, and scheduling work across the executors [@chambers2018].

Every time a Spark application starts, the driver process has to communicate with the cluster manager, to acquire workers to perform the necessary tasks. In other words, the cluster manager decides if Spark can use some of the resources (i.e. some of the machines) of the cluster. If the cluster manager allow Spark to use the nodes it needs, the driver program will break the application into many small tasks, and will assign these tasks to the worker nodes.

The executor processes, are the processes that take place within each one of the worker nodes. Each executor process is composed of a set of tasks, and the worker node is responsible for performing and executing these tasks that were assigned to him, by the driver program. After executing these tasks, the worker node will send the results back to the driver node (or the driver program). If they need, the worker nodes can communicate with each other, while performing its tasks.

This structure is represented in @fig-spark-application:

![Spark application structure on a cluster of computers](../Figures/spark-application.png){#fig-spark-application fig-align="center"}

When you run Spark on a cluster of computers, you write the code of your Spark application (i.e. your `pyspark` code) on your (single) local computer, and then, submit this code to the driver node. After that, the driver node takes care of the rest, by starting your application, creating your Spark Session, asking for new worker nodes, sending the tasks to be performed, collecting and compiling the results and giving back these results to you.

However, when you run Spark on your (single) local computer, the process is very similar. But, instead of submitting your code to another computer (which is the driver node), you will submit to your own local computer. In other words, when Spark is running on single-node mode, your computer becomes the driver and the worker node at the same time.


## Spark application versus `pyspark` application

The `pyspark` package is just a tool to write Spark applications using the python programming language. This means, that a `pyspark` application is a Spark application written in python.

With this conception in mind, you can understand that a `pyspark` application is a description of a Spark application. However, at the end, this description is translated into a raw Spark application that will be executed by Spark.

To write a `pyspark` application, you write a python script that uses the `pyspark` library. When you execute this python script with the python interpreter, the application will be automatically converted to Spark code, and will be sent to Spark to be executed across the cluster;


## Core parts of a Spark application

In this section, I want to point out the core parts that composes a Spark application. Every `pyspark` program that you write will have these "core parts". In summary, most Spark applications will have three core parts:

1) importing Spark libraries (or packages);

2) an instantiation of a Spark Session. In other words, you define a entry point to your Spark Session, with an object that holds all the information of your Spark Session;

3) a set of transformations and actions over Spark DataFrames;


### Spark libraries (or packages)

Spark comes with a lot of functionality installed. But, in order to use it, you have to import most of these functionalities to your session. 

If you write your Spark application through `pyspark`, this means that you have to import specific packages of `pyspark` to your python session.

For example, most of the functions that we use to define our transformations and aggregations comes from the `pyspark.sql.functions` package. 

That is why we usually start our python scripts by importing functions from this package:

```{python}
from pyspark.sql.functions import sum, col
sum_expr = sum(col('Value'))
```


Or, importing the entire package with the `import` keyword:

```{python}
import pyspark.sql.functions as F
sum_expr = F.sum(F.col('Value'))
```



### Starting your Spark Session

Every Spark application starts with a Spark Session. Basically, the Spark Session is the entry point to your application. This means that, in every `pyspark` program that you write, **you should always start by defining your Spark Session**. We do this, by using the `getOrCreate()` method from `pyspark.sql.SparkSession.builder`.

Just store the result of this method in any python object. Is very common to name this object as `spark`, like in the example below. This way, you can access all the information and methods of Spark from this `spark` object.

```{python}
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
spark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()
```

## Building your first Spark application

To demonstrate what a `pyspark` program looks like, lets write and run our first example of a Spark application. This Spark application will build a simple table of 1 column that contains 5 numbers, and then, it will return a simple python list containing this five numbers as a result.

### Writing the code

First, create a new blank text file in your computer, and save it somewhere with the name `spark-example.py`. Do not forget to put the `.py` extension in the name. This program we are writing together is a python program, and should be treated as such. With the `.py` extension in the name file, you are stating this fact quite clearly to your computer.

After you created and saved the python script (i.e. the text file with the `.py` extension), you can start writing your `pyspark` program. As we noted in the previous section, you should always start your `pyspark` program by defining your Spark Session, with this code:

```{python}
#| eval: false
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
spark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()
```

After you defined your Spark Session, and saved it in an object called `spark`, you can now access all Spark's functionality through this `spark` object.

To create our first Spark table we use the `range()` method from the `spark` object. The `range()` method works similarly as the standard python function called `range()`. It basically creates a sequence of numbers, from 0 to $n - 1$. However, this `range()` method from `spark` stores this sequence of numbers as rows in a Spark table (or a Spark DataFrame):

```{python}
#| eval: false
table = spark.range(5)
```

After this step, we want to collect all the rows of the resulting table into a python list. And to do that, we use the `collect()` method from the Spark table:

```{python}
#| eval: false
result = table.collect()
print(result)
```

So, the entire program is composed of these three parts (or sections) of code. If you need it, the entire program is reproduced below. You can copy and paste all of this code to your python script, and then, save it:

```{python}
#| eval: false
# The entire program:
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
spark = SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate()

table = spark.range(5)
result = table.collect()
print(result)
```

### Executing the code

Now that you have written your first Spark application with `pyspark`, you want to execute this application and see its results. Yet, to run a `pyspark` program, remember that you need to have the necessary software installed on your machine. I talk about how to install these software at @sec-install-software.

Anyway, to execute this `pyspark` that you wrote, you need send this script to the python interpreter, and to do this you need to: 1) open a terminal inside the folder where you python script is stored; and, 2) use the python command from the terminal with the name of your python script.

If you do not know how to open a terminal from inside a folder of your computer, you can consult @sec-open-terminal of this book, where I teach you how to do it.

In my current situation, I running Spark on a Ubuntu distribution, and, I saved the `spark-example.py` script inside a folder called `SparkExample`. This folder is located at the path `~/Documentos/Projetos/Livros/Introd-pyspark/SparkExample` of my computer. This means that, I need to open a terminal that is rooted inside this `SparkExample` folder.

You probably have saved your `spark-example.py` file in a different folder of your computer. This means that you need to open the terminal from a different folder.

After I opened a terminal rooted inside the `SparkExample` folder. I just use the `python3` command to access the python interpreter, and, give the name of the python script that I want to execute. In this case, the `spark-example.py` file. As a result, our first `pyspark` program will be executed:

```{terminal}
Terminal$ python3 spark-example.py
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
path_py <- fs::path_abs("../SparkExample/spark-example.py")
result <- system2("python3", args = path_py, stdout = TRUE)
cat(result)
```

You can see in the above result, that this Spark application produces a sequence of numbers, from 0 to 4, and, returns this sequence as a set of `Row` objects, inside a python list.

Congratulations! You have just run your first Spark application using `pyspark`!
