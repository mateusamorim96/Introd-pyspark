        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "In this chapter, you will understand how Spark represents and manages tables (or tabular data). Different programming languages and frameworks use different names to describe a table. But, in Apache Spark, tables are referred as Spark DataFrames.\n",
        "\n",
        "In `pyspark`, these DataFrames are stored inside python objects of class `pyspark.sql.dataframe.DataFrame`, and all the methods present in this class, are commonly referred as the DataFrame API of Spark. This is the most important API of Spark. Much of your Spark applications will heavily use this API to compose your data transformations and data flows [@chambers2018].\n",
        "\n",
        "## Spark DataFrames versus Spark Datasets\n",
        "\n",
        "Spark have two notions of structured data: DataFrames and Datasets. In summary, a Spark Dataset, is a distributed collection of data [@sparkdoc]. In contrast, a Spark DataFrame is a Spark Dataset organized into named columns [@sparkdoc].\n",
        "\n",
        "This means that, Spark DataFrames are very similar to tables as we know in relational databases - RDBMS. So in a Spark DataFrame, each column has a name, and they all have the same number of rows. Furthermore, all the rows inside a column must store the same type of data, but each column can store a different type of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the other hand, Spark Datasets are considered a collection of any type of data. So a Dataset might be a collection of unstructured data as well, like log files, JSON and XML trees, etc. Spark Datasets can be created and transformed trough the Dataset API of Spark. But this API is available only in Scala and Java API's of Spark. For this reason, we do not act directly on Datasets with `pyspark`, only DataFrames. That's ok, because for the most part of applications, we do want to use DataFrames, and not Datasets, to represent our data.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, what makes a Spark DataFrame different from other dataframes? Like the `pandas` DataFrame? Or the R native `data.frame` structure? Is the **distributed** aspect of it. Spark DataFrames are based on Spark Datasets, and these Datasets are collections of data that are distributed across the cluster. As an example, lets suppose you have the following table stored as a Spark DataFrame:\n",
        "\n",
        "| ID  | Name   | Value |\n",
        "|-----|--------|-------|\n",
        "| 1   | Anne   | 502   |\n",
        "| 2   | Carls  | 432   |\n",
        "| 3   | Stoll  | 444   |\n",
        "| 4   | Percy  | 963   |\n",
        "| 5   | Martha | 123   |\n",
        "| 6   | Sigrid | 621   |\n",
        "\n",
        "If you are running Spark in a 4 nodes cluster (one is the driver node, and the other three are worker nodes). Each worker node of the cluster will store a section of this data. So you, as the programmer, will see, manage and transform this table as if it was a single and unified table. But behind the hoods, Spark will split this data and store it as many fragments across the Spark cluster. @fig-distributed-df presents this notion in a visual manner.\n",
