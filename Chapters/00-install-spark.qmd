title: How to install Spark
---

In order to build and run any Spark application through `pyspark`, you have to install Apache Spark in your computer. Apache Spark is available to all three major operating systems in the market today (macOS, Windows and Linux). 

The process of installation is kind of similar in all three OS's. But some steps work differently in each OS. Currently, I (the author of this book) does have access to a macOS machine, and because of that, I will not describe the installation process of Spark on this platform. If you have access to a macOS machine, and are willing to describe the installation process, I would be happy to review a PR with such content.

## First step: Download Apache Spark

First, you need to download Apache Spark from the [official website for the project](https://spark.apache.org/downloads)^[<https://spark.apache.org/downloads>]. Currently, the Apache Spark does not offers installers or package programs to install the software for you. In other words,  is available only as a TAR file (`.tgz`).

We usually install external software on Windows by using installers (i.e. executable files - `.exe`) that perform all the necessary steps to install the software in your machine. However, currently, the Apache Spark project does not offers such installers. This means that you have to install it yourself.

When you download Apache Spark from the official website, you will get all files of the program inside a TAR file (`.tgz`).

## Next steps

In short, the next steps for installing Spark are:

1. Extract all files from the TAR file (`.tgz`);
2. Install Java Runtime and SDK;
3. Set a few environment variables;

These steps are simple, but they work differently depending on what operating system you are currently in. As a result, the next sections describes these steps for each operating system. 


## On Windows

After you downloaded Spark to your machine, you need to extract all files from the TAR file (`.tgz`) to a specific location of your computer. It can be anywhere, just choose a place. As an example, I will extract the files to a folder called `Spark` at my hard disk `C:/`. 

To extract these files, you can use very popular UI tools like [7zip](<https://7-zip.org/>)^[<https://7-zip.org/>] or [WinRAR](<https://www.win-rar.com/>)^[<https://www.win-rar.com/>]. But, I will use the `tar` command line tool from the terminal to do this.

```{terminal, eval = FALSE}
