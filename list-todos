TODOS:
- Change "How to run a Python program section", lets just present a first example of Spark program, and show how to run it.
- When introducing DataFrames, just say cite that, you can create a DataFrame by reading a file, just a simple example, leave the complete discussion of import/export data to a complete different chapter.
